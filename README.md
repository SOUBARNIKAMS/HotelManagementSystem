# HotelManagementSystem

Hotel Management System is a command-line application written in Java that simulates the operations of a real hotel. The application allows admins to manage employees and credit salaries, and customers to book rooms and order food. Additionally, it features a graphical user interface (GUI) feedback form created using `javax.swing` for customers to provide their feedback on the hotel services.
